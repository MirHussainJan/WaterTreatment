            <div>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-2">Water softeners use ion exchange to replace calcium and magnesium ions with sodium or potassium ions. This process removes hardness from the water, making it soft and suitable for household use.</p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700">
                <li>Hard water enters the softener tank.</li>
                <li>Resin beads attract and hold hard minerals.</li>
                <li>Softened water exits the tank for household use.</li>
                <li>Regeneration flushes minerals from the resin beads.</li>
